@W: MT529 :"c:\users\erny\documents\fer\diglog\labosi\lab6\source\sem_toplevel.vhd":20:4:20:12|Found inferred clock sem|clk_25m which controls 24 sequential elements including R_clk_div[23:0]. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
